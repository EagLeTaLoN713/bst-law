#Removed VORP name as not Official VORP Resource
#Credit to Original Creators listed in vorp_law repo "https://github.com/bythewood/vorp_law"
#Added Ability to Create Witness via shooting or melee of NPC's. 
#Law is spawned in Radius around the playerped
#Player can choose to fight law or flee to end "Wanted" status


---------TO DO----------
#integrate CRIMES DATEVIEW to add more diverse crimes and possible law presence

#add bounty value to each LAW killed thus creating need to "player" bounties
    - storing bounty amounts after reconnect
    
#add ability to not spawn NPC Law if local "player" law is within radius of crime committed.
